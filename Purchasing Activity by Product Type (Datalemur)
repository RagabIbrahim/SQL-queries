SELECT order_date, product_type,

  sum(quantity) over( partition by product_type order by order_date ) as cum_purchased 
  
FROM total_trans
order by order_date;

** partition
It gives aggregated columns with each record in the specified table.

We have 15 records in the Orders table. In the query output of SQL PARTITION BY, 
we also get 15 rows along with Min, Max and average values.

** group by
t gives one row per group in result set. For example, we get a result for each group of CustomerCity in the GROUP BY clause.
